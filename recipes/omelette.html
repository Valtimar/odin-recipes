    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Crab and egg go very well together in this delightful crab omelet. Fresh crab meat is best but if you can't find it, use canned.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small potato, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ pound fresh crabmeat, drained and flaked</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1 (1.5 ounce) box raisins</li>
        <li>¼ cup peas</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry potato in hot oil until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a plate lined with paper towels, leaving excess oil in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add crab to the skillet and season with salt and pepper; stir. Cover the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Stir tomatoes into mixture and cook another 2 minutes. Add raisins, peas, and red bell pepper; stir and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour eggs over mixture in the skillet. Cook until eggs set, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip omelet and cook 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate and serve hot with potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
